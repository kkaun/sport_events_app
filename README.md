# sport_events_app

Notes:
- The project is designed using the simplified vertical architecture approach.
- Project uses flutter_riverpod as a minimalistic and universal solution for both DI and state management, in order to demonstrate base scalability and structuring possibilities.
- To comply the prototype, 'timeEnding' field was added both to data class and mock dataset.
- As long as the event model implies network img urls usage, the real urls from the internet are mocked and rendered.
- A small amount of logic/nav corrections was made due to minor logical inconsistencies between the task description and design. All of them are marked as comments in code.
